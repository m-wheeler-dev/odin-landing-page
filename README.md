# odin-landing-page
Landing Page project from The Odin Project

This project is to take an image of a landing page and make a similar page in order to use and grow your CSS skills. 

I used this as another opportunity to use Git more, but I admit I didn't use it as much as I would've liked to.

As for the CSS, flexbox is used for spacing and element placement. The photos are all from Unsplash with the credits in a figcaption underneath. The MW logo however is my own I made on Canva. 

The links in the header do in fact work and take you to my website, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

I appreciate any and all feedback!

~ Thanks
